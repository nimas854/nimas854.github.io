<h2 id="content">Entering uncharted territory... aka, I have no clue what I'm doing!😵‍💫</h2>
<p>I know this software is new, but as soon as I heard about this new module 🫨, I was like, 'What the hell is that?' I only knew that a database is a collection of data. With the little knowledge I had about this module, I thought it would be tough and that I had just wasted my father's money 🥲. But after the first class, I realized, 'This isn't that bad or hard!'

All thanks to Miss Palden Wangmo Dorji (my lecturer), who has a great way of teaching—I’m able to understand it easily!

Wanna know what I’ve learned so far? 🤔</p>

<h4 id="Content">Key Takeaways from the Unit</h4>
<p>Databases Are Superheroes – They save us from messy files, lost papers, and chaotic spreadsheets. Instead of storing data in random places, a database organizes everything neatly.<p>
<p>File-Processing Systems Are Like Old, Slow Turtles 🐢 They have redundancy issues, security problems, and make finding data a nightmare where a database system is like an upgraded rocket ship🚀 – fast, secure, and efficient.</p>
<p> Databases started simple but evolved into powerful tools that handle massive amounts of data with ease.</p>

<p>Sorry for the Handwriting🥲 but i swear my answer are correct ! 😅(Thank you ChatGPT)</p>

<p>There are many different data models and they can be classified into 4 categories(1. Entity-Relationship Model
2. Semi-structured Data Model
3. Object Based Data Models
4. Relational Model) among them i prefer Entity-Relationship Model because i had spent 2hr to do creat a Entity -Relationship Model for my assignment.</p>

<p>This is my ER model for my assignment, it took me 2hr to create this model and i am very proud of myself.🤣</p>
<p>But the other 3 models 🥲 i didn't understand because i was dreaming about my favorite food 🍔🍟🥤 while my lecturer was explaining it.(Sorry miss😓)</p>

<h4 id="Content">Why This Matter</h4>
<p> Efficiency = More Free Time – A good database system saves time. More time = more naps. That’s reason enough to care! 😴</p>
<p>Security Matters – Imagine if your embarrassing search history was stored in an unprotected Excel file. Exactly. A database system keeps important information safe from prying eyes! 🔐</p>
<p>The relational model, SQL, and different data models help in designing well-structured databases.🫨</p><br>

<h4 id="Content">Personal Growth and Reflection</h4>
<p>Before: "Databases sound boring."
After: "Whoa, databases run EVERYTHING?!?"</p>
<p>I now see databases in everyday life—Netflix recommendations, my bank app and etc(End of thinking capacity😊)</p>
<p>I don’t understand EVERYTHING, but at least I know the important stuff!🤣(Thank you so much miss, hope you keep the same energy in the next classes)</p>
